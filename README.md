# helpAR
 I really, really hate hand-recoding ARPAbet.
 
 If you do too, this might help.
 
 ### what
*`helpAR`* is currently intended for use in RStudio. The notebook [helpAR.Rmd](helpAR.Rmd) contains directions for use with the code divided into labeled chunks. 

Current status: it runs when I test it (~30ms to generate IPA equivalents for a column with 350k rows). I would like to make using it smoother for people who aren't me eventually.

If you're not me and you're using it, [report issues here.](https://github.com/cyrusae/helpAR/issues)
